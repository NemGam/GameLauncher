# GameLauncher

# CURRENTLY UNDER A COMPLETE REWORK
I've learned a lot of valuable experience that I have to apply here! Stay tuned!

This is the Game Launcher to simplify the access to the games on my github!
Made with C#, WPF, .Net and MongoDB

Current features:
- Download the games w/o the need to find the repository.
- Update games when the new version is available! No need to check the github for games updates.

Planned features:
- Game deletion
- Game icons
- Better layout
- Better error handling
- Launcher's self update
